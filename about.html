            <h1>About Patrick</h1>
                <p>
                    Patrick grew up in the small town of Elkview, about 20 north of Charleston, WV. From a young age, Patrick enjoyed designing and making things and was always a big dreamer. In fifth grade he and a few of his friends decided that they wanted to design, build, and launch a model rocket that would make it into space. Although this never transpired, they did take the time to draw out and design the rocket and even started to build it. Ever since Patrick has enjoyed building things and solving problems.
