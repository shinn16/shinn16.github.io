                        First off, why the beach theme for the site? Well, if you know me, then you know I am a huge fan of Hawian Print shirts. I have a rather large collection of them, 17 to be exact. Almost every day of the week in warmer months I can be found wearing one. I am also a fan of just all things beach like, my apartment in decorated with a wide variety of beach themed items. Since my life is essentailly decorated like a beach, I desided it would be fitting if my website followed suite.

                        From a very young age I have always loved to design and build things. Legos and Erector Sets were my favorite toys. In the fifth grade, a few friends and I wanted to design and build a model rocket that could go into space, though we never achieved our lofty goal, we very much enjoyed the process of designing the rocket and building small models of it.

                    <p class="content">
                        That passion to design and build has only grown since then. I elected to go into the field of computer science because it is one place where creativity and passion can truley thrive. I am a massive
                        supporter of open source software and the ideals that come along with it. I hope to one day create a company that boasts a Linux based operating system that has the abilty to compete head to head with
                        Microsoft and Apple.
