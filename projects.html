            <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>
                    I have a variety of projects going on at the moment, most of which you can actively track on <a class="link" href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
                </p>
            <h4  style="margin-bottom: -.8em;"><a class="link" href="https://github.com/shinn16/WAN-Tracker" target="_blank">WAN-Tracker</a></h4>
            <p>
                The WAN-Tracker project is a simple set of scripts that I wrote to help him automate maintanence of his home server. Although the program would run fine without most of the scripts, I included them so that others could install and run his software with as little trouble as possible. This software is specialized for Linux servers, but in theory should run on OSX as well, although this has never been tested with the new versions. A version for Windows is not currently being developed, although this may change in the future.
            </p>
             <h4  style="margin-bottom: -.8em;"><a class="link" href="https://github.com/shinn16/Java-Wan-Tracker" target="_blank">Java WAN-Tracker</a></h4>
            <p>
                This is a Java implementation of WAN-Tracker just for fun. Should have the same functionality as the original once completed. At the current time, there is no intention of actively running this, it is simply a fun project for Java.
            </p>
            <h4  style="margin-bottom: -.8em;"><a class="link" href="https://github.com/shinn16/Conky" target="_blank">Conky</a></h4>
            <p>
                Conkies a custom system monitors for Linux. You can learn more about them <a class="link" href="http://conky.sourceforge.net/documentation.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I have put together a few for my amusement and simply because I find them useful. In order for them to work, they will need a few edits on a system by system base. I built them to work on my computer, so they are specilized for my particular needs. The files are commented, so they shouldn't be to hard to edit and get working for your needs.
