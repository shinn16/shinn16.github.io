                <p class="content">
                    I grew up in the small town of Elkview, about 20 miles north of Charleston, WV. From a young age, I enjoyed designing and making things and was always a big dreamer. In fifth grade a few friends and I decided that they wanted to design, build, and launch a model rocket that would make it into space. Although this never transpired, we did take the time to draw out and design the rocket and even started to build it. Ever since I have enjoyed building things and solving problems. 
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    That passion to design and build has only grown since then. I elected to go into the field of computer science because it is one place where creativity and passion can truley thrive. I am a massive
                    supporter of open source software and the ideals that come along with it. I hope to one day create a company that boasts a Linux based operating system that has the abilty to compete head to head with
                    Microsoft and Apple.
