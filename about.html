            <h1>About Patrick</h1>
                <p>
                    I grew up in the small town of Elkview, about 20 miles north of Charleston, WV. From a young age, I enjoyed designing and making things and was always a big dreamer. In fifth grade a few friends and I decided that they wanted to design, build, and launch a model rocket that would make it into space. Although this never transpired, we did take the time to draw out and design the rocket and even started to build it. Ever since I have enjoyed building things and solving problems. My hobbies include flying remote control aircraft, astronomy, photography, ceramics, server maintenance, programming, growing Bonsai Trees, and advocating for Linux.  I hope to one day run my own company that boasts a Linux based operating system that will become main stream.
